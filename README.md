# Web-Design-Challenge

This repo contains the source contents of a website I developed and deployed at https://pnisenson.github.io/. The site contains 7 pages: a landing page (index.html), four visualization pages, a comparison page and a data page. Each page shares a Navbar constructed using Bootstrap. Pages were largely customized using Bootstrap and a CSS file (style.css). 

The purpose of the website is to present the information obtained in the WeatherPy assignment. Refer to my repository "python-api-challenge" for details.
